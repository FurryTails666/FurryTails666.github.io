For dog owners, deciding between a collar and a harness has always been a challenging dilemma. The choice of leash tool not only affects the comfort and safety of your dog but also impacts the owner\u0026rsquo;s control and walking experience. Selecting the right tool for your dog is crucial, yet it\u0026rsquo;s not a straightforward decision. Both collars and harnesses have their own advantages and disadvantages, as well as specific situations where they are most appropriate. This article will analyze both options from multiple perspectives to help dog owners make the most informed choice.\nCollars The primary function of a collar is to protect the dog and make it easier to control their behavior.\nAdvantages: Lightweight and easy to wear. Allows the owner to clearly communicate commands. Available in various styles and easy to purchase. Disadvantages: More likely to cause tracheal injury, especially for dogs that tend to pull. Easier to escape from. Suitable for: Dogs that do not have issues with pulling and remain calm during outings. Harnesses Harnesses cover a larger area, helping to distribute the pulling force and reduce the risk of injury caused by pulling.\nAdvantages: Effectively reduces the force of pulling. Multiple buckles can change the pulling direction. Easier to train and guide the dog. Disadvantages: Can cause fur to mat. Takes longer to put on (depending on the design). Suitable for: Dogs that often pull and do not listen to commands, small dogs, and dogs in training. Tips for Choosing Between a Collar or Harness The main reason for dogs pulling and getting injured is not the collar or harness itself but the lack of proper training and guidance on how to behave while out. The main reasons for pulling include:\nToo excited and constantly pulling the owner. Scared by external noises and trying to hide. Not going out enough, so always curious about the surroundings. Owners should spend more time taking their dogs out and patiently teach them to stay calm during outings, which not only protects the dog but also ensures the safety of other pedestrians. Differences Between Collars and Harnesses Collar: Suitable for dogs of all breeds and sizes, especially large dogs. Convenient for daily wear but can put strain on the neck. Harness: Stylish and evenly distributes pressure when worn on the dog. Especially suitable for small dogs and breeds with respiratory issues. Does not harm the throat or chest as a collar might. Conclusion When choosing between a collar and a harness, consider your dog\u0026rsquo;s behavior and safety. Harnesses are generally more suitable in urban environments due to their higher level of protection and safety compared to collars. When choosing a harness, pay attention to features like breathability, non-restrictive design, and proper fit.\nRecommended Products Here are some selected products from Amazon that I hope will provide helpful suggestions for owners.
